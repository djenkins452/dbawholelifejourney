- When disabled: Hidden from menu and dashboard
- Default: Enabled (True)

### Error Handling and Retry UI for Capture (Task 262)

**Summary:** Implemented user-friendly error states and retry functionality for the Capture feature.

- Updated detail page to show specific error titles and suggestions instead of generic "Processing Failed"
- Added error styling with distinct visual treatment for failed entries

**Retry Functionality:**

- Retry button only shown for retryable errors (upload, transcription, summarization failures)
- Non-retryable errors (mic denied, timeout) show appropriate messaging
- JavaScript handles retry polling and page reload on success

**Email Notification:**
- Added `send_processing_complete_email` function for delayed processing completion
- Created email template `templates/capture/email/processing_complete.html`

### Add Cloudinary Audio Storage Support

**Summary:** Added Cloudinary as the audio storage backend for the Capture feature. This uses the existing Cloudinary credentials already configured for image storage, eliminating the need for a separate S3 bucket.

**How it works:**
1. When recording/uploading audio, the frontend sends audio to the server
2. Server uploads to Cloudinary using the video resource type (handles audio)
3. Cloudinary returns a permanent URL for playback
4. Audio files are tagged for 7-day retention tracking

**Changes:**
- Created `apps/capture/cloudinary_storage.py` - Cloudinary upload/delete functions
- Updated `apps/capture/views.py` - Added `CaptureCloudinaryUploadView`, modified submit flow to detect Cloudinary
- Updated `apps/capture/urls.py` - Added cloudinary-upload endpoint
- Updated `templates/capture/capture_record.html` - Handle Cloudinary upload mode
- Updated `templates/capture/capture_upload.html` - Handle Cloudinary upload mode

**Storage Priority:**
1. Cloudinary (if configured) - uses existing credentials
2. S3 (if configured) - requires separate bucket setup
3. Mock mode (no storage) - for development only

### Add Play/Download Actions to Capture List

**Summary:** Added action buttons to the Audio Capture list view so users can play and download audio directly without navigating to the detail page.

**Changes:**
- Added play button (opens modal with audio player)
- Added download button (direct download link)
- Existing delete button remains
- Audio modal includes playback controls and close button
- Icons use consistent styling with other action buttons

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/capture/capture_list.html` - Added action icons column, audio modal, and JavaScript
