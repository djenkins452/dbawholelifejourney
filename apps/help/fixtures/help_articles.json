            "content": "## What is Whole Life Journey?\n\nWhole Life Journey is a **personal life operating system** that brings together the different dimensions of your life into one intelligent platform. Instead of using separate apps for journaling, health tracking, task management, and goals—WLJ connects everything so the AI can see the whole picture.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nMost apps only see one part of your life. WLJ sees:\n- **Your moods** from journaling\n- **Your health patterns** from tracking\n- **Your productivity** from tasks completed\n- **Your spiritual journey** from faith tracking\n- **Your intentions** from your stated goals\n\n**The connection is the power.** When you journal about stress and the AI notices you also skipped workouts that week, it can make that connection for you.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### 1. Check Your Dashboard Daily\nYour Dashboard is home base. Even a 30-second glance keeps you connected to your goals and shows you what needs attention.\n\n### 2. Start with One Module\nDon't try to use everything at once. Pick what matters most:\n- **Journaling** if you want self-awareness\n- **Health** if you're focused on physical wellness\n- **Faith** if you want to track your spiritual journey\n- **Life** if you need task/project management\n\n### 3. Enable AI Features\nIn Preferences, enable AI for personalized insights. The more data you provide, the smarter it gets.\n\n### 4. Set Goals in Purpose\nThe Purpose module anchors everything. When the AI knows your goals, it can prioritize better.\n\n## Core Features\n\n| Module | What You Log | What You Get |\n|--------|--------------|-------------|\n| **Dashboard** | Nothing—it aggregates | Daily insights, celebrations, nudges |\n| **Journal** | Thoughts, moods | Emotional pattern analysis |\n| **Health** | Weight, food, medicine, vitals | Health trend tracking |\n| **Faith** | Prayers, scripture | Answered prayer history |\n| **Life** | Tasks, projects, events | Productivity patterns |\n| **Purpose** | Goals, direction | Drift detection, alignment |\n| **Scan** | Photos of food, medicine | Instant data entry |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Customize Preferences** - Choose your theme, modules, and AI coaching style\n2. **Write your first journal entry** - Build your streak\n3. **Set your Purpose** - Annual direction and goals\n4. **Enable SMS notifications** - For medicine and task reminders",

Click **Scan** in navigation\n2. Grant camera permission\n3. Point at item\n4. Tap **capture**\n5. Wait 2-5 seconds for AI analysis\n6. Review pre-filled form\n7. Save\n\n## What AI Detects\n\n| Item Type | What Happens |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| Packaged Food | Brand identified, nutrition looked up |\n| Home-Cooked | Portions estimated, macros calculated |\n| Nutrition Label | All data extracted |\n| Medicine Bottle | Name, dose, pharmacy extracted |\n| Document | Categorized, saved |\n\n## Food Recognition\n\n### Packaged Foods\n- AI identifies brand and product\n- Looks up actual nutrition facts\n- Returns all macros and serving size\n\n### Home-Cooked/Restaurant\n- Estimates portion visually\n- Uses databases for ingredients\n- Good approximations, not exact\n\n## Tips for Best Results\n\n1. **Good lighting** - Natural light\n2. **Clear focus** - Readable text\n3. **Include labels** - Best accuracy\n4. **Whole plate visible** - For portions\n5. **Steady hand** - Avoid blur\n\n## Privacy\n\n- Images processed and deleted\n- Encrypted transmission\n- No sharing\n- Optional—use manual entry instead",

What needs attention today\n2. Ordered by importance (faith first if enabled)\n3. Completable with one click\n\n### Opening Message\nBrief daily check-in based on:\n- Your current state\n- What matters today\n- Your coaching style\n\n### Trend Analysis\n- **Weekly** - Last 7 days patterns\n- **Monthly** - Bigger-picture trends\n- **Drift Detection** - When actions don't match intentions\n\n### Reflection Prompts\nPersonalized journaling suggestions based on:\n- Recent activity\n- Gaps in tracking\n- Goals you've set\n\n## Priority Ordering (Faith-First)\n\nIf Faith enabled:\n1. Faith items\n2. Purpose items\n3. Long-term goals\n4. Commitments\n5. Maintenance\n6. Optional\n\n## Enabling the Assistant\n\nRequires extra consent (deeper data access):\n\n1. **Preferences > AI Settings**\n2. Enable **AI Features**\n3. Enable **Personal Assistant**\n4. Accept consent\n5. Assistant appears in navigation\n\n## What the Assistant Sees\n\n- Journal entries and moods\n- Health data and adherence\n- Task completion\n- Prayer requests (if Faith)\n- Goal progress\n\n**This is why separate consent is required.**\n\n## Tips\n\n1. **Check daily** - Morning priority review\n2. **Complete promptly** - Mark done when finished\n3. **Log consistently** - Better data = better suggestions\n4. **Set clear Purpose** - AI needs to know intentions",
