## INTRO

Welcome to Whole Life Journey.

This is your personal space—a private place to reflect, track what matters, and grow at your own pace.

Before you begin, we'd like to walk you through a few ways you can make this experience truly yours. Nothing here is required. Everything can be changed later. We simply want you to know what's possible.

---

## YOUR PROFILE

Let's start with your profile.

Your profile is simply how the app knows you. Your name, your photo if you choose to add one, and your email for signing in.

Why does this matter? Because when you open your journal or see an encouraging message, it feels more personal when it's addressed to you—not a stranger.

You're always in control of what's here. Update it anytime, or leave it simple. It's entirely up to you.

---

## YOUR PREFERENCES

Now let's talk about preferences. This is where you shape the experience to fit your life.

### Appearance

First, how do you want the app to look?

We offer several visual themes—some light, some dark, some inspired by faith, nature, sports, or a simple, minimal style. You might prefer a calming blue or a warm sunset tone. There's no wrong choice. Pick what feels right, and know you can always come back and try something different.

### The Modules

Whole Life Journey is organized into modules—areas of focus that support different parts of your life.

There's a journal, for capturing your thoughts, reflections, and daily moments. A health section, for tracking things like weight, fasting, and energy. A faith area, for those who want to include scripture, prayer, and spiritual milestones. A life section, for organizing projects, tasks, and the practical things that keep life running. And a purpose area, for setting direction—your goals, your word for the year, the things that give your days meaning.

Here's what's important: you don't have to use all of them. You might start with just the journal and nothing else. Or maybe health tracking is your focus right now, and the rest can wait.

Each module can be turned on or off with a simple toggle. The app adjusts to show only what you've chosen. No clutter. No pressure.

As we continue building Whole Life Journey, new modules will become available—things like habit tracking, relationship nurturing, and personal finances. When they're ready, you'll see them here, and you can decide if they're right for you.

### Your Timezone and Location

We also ask about your timezone—not to track you, but so that timestamps on your entries make sense. When you write a journal entry at 10pm, it should say 10pm, not some confusing number from the other side of the world.

If you'd like, you can share your city. This allows us to show things like local weather or time-aware greetings. But again, this is optional. Leave it blank if you prefer.

## AI COACHING

One of the more personal features of Whole Life Journey is our AI coaching.

If you choose to enable it, the app can offer gentle insights based on what you've written—patterns in your mood, encouragement when you're struggling, or a thoughtful question to help you reflect more deeply.

But here's what makes it special: you get to choose the voice.

Some people want a warm, supportive partner—someone who feels like a trusted friend. Others prefer a direct coach who keeps things clear and action-focused. There's a gentle guide for those who need patience and softness. And for a bit of personality, we've included voices like a Southern Belle with wisdom and grace, a Texas Rancher with grit and honesty, a New York straight-talker who won't waste your time, and a California spirit who brings calm, mindful energy.

Each voice changes how the AI speaks to you—not what it knows, but how it connects. Try one, and if it doesn't feel right, switch to another. The goal is for you to feel understood.

And if you'd rather not use AI at all, simply leave it off. Every other part of the app works perfectly without it.

---

## FAITH SETTINGS

For those who choose to enable the faith module, there's one more personal touch: your preferred Bible translation.

We connect to a library of translations so you can read scripture in the version that speaks to you—whether that's a traditional translation, a modern one, or something in between.

This setting only appears when you've turned on the faith module. If faith isn't part of your journey right now, you won't see it at all.

---

## EVERYTHING IS OPTIONAL

Let's pause here and say something clearly.

Every single thing we've described is optional.

You can skip your photo. You can leave your location blank. You can turn off every module except one. You can ignore the AI coaching entirely. You can change your theme a dozen times.

This is your space. We've built the options, but you decide what fits.

And nothing is permanent. Every preference, every setting, every choice you make today can be changed tomorrow. The app grows with you.

---

## PRIVACY AND TRUST

One more thing before we let you explore.

Your data stays yours. Your journal entries, your health numbers, your prayers, your goals—they're private. We don't sell your information. We don't share it. We don't read it.

The AI features, when you use them, process your words to offer insights, but that's between you and the app. No one else sees it.

We built Whole Life Journey because we believe everyone deserves a place to reflect, to grow, and to take care of themselves—without judgment, without pressure, and without someone looking over their shoulder.

---

## LET'S BEGIN

That's everything you need to know to get started.

When you're ready, you'll land on your dashboard—a calm, simple view that shows what matters most today. From there, you can write your first journal entry, explore the modules you've chosen, or simply look around.

There's no rush. There's no right way to do this. Just begin.

Welcome to Whole Life Journey.
